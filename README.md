# ForensiTrain

ForensiTrain is a simple OSINT utility that performs live lookups on phone
numbers. It uses public APIs and command line tools such as Maigret to collect
metadata about a target number. Results include country, carrier information,
potential social media profiles and known breach exposure.

This project is provided **for educational and lawful OSINT use only**. Ensure
you comply with local laws and API terms of service before running queries.
